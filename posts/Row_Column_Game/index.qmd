## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

In this post, I explore the design of intelligent decision-making strategies for the
Row–Column Game, a turn-based two-player game defined by a surprisingly strategic rule:

> After the first move, each player must select a cell in the same row or column as  
> the opponent’s previous move.

The game is played on an $n \times n$ grid of positive integers.
Each chosen cell adds to the player’s score and is removed from the board.  
The game continues until no legal moves remain.

Although the rules are simple, the game produces a rich space of decisions:
sometimes aggressively taking a high-value cell is optimal, but often it hands your opponent a devastating reply.  
This makes the game a perfect playground for experimenting with different kinds of AI strategies.

## Understanding Initiative and Positional Advantage {#sec-advantage}

Before considering individual strategies, it is important to understand the
fundamental asymmetries built into the Row–Column Game. Although the rules are
simple and both players face the same restrictions, the first move shapes the
entire structure of the remaining game, and often creates a natural advantage
for Player 1.
